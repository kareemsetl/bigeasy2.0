          <h3>A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE</h3>
          <div>Big Easy Magazine is the online home for progressive New Orleans. Our publication features original content published both weekly and monthly. The issues we cover are not always unique, but our coverage is unique in the way we approach them. We examine the issues we cover—from race to politics and from LGBTQ issues to the environment, through the eyes of the people of New Orleans.</div>
          <h3>UNAPOLOGETICALLY PROGRESSIVE</h3>
          <div>From the beginning, we have proudly stated that we are a progressive publication. We see the world through a progressive lens, and we believe in such values as love and inclusiveness. We only state facts, and we will never mislead our readers. But at Big Easy Magazine, we are unapologetically progressive.</div>
          <h3>MISSION STATEMENT</h3>
          <div>For a city under threat from water, for a city that stays up all night, in a world in need of different perspectives. With insight and introspection, we strive to deliver thorough and thoughtful coverage with a progressive voice about the issues that truly matter to the New Orleans community.</div>
          <h3>CORE VALUES</h3>
          <div>Big Easy Magazine is guided daily by the following core values:</div>
          <div><em>Kindness</em><br /><em>Compassion</em><br /><em>Equality</em><br /><em>Love</em><br /><em>Justice</em><br /><em>Inclusiveness</em></div>
